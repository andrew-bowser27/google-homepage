This is my first time recreating a website, specifically the Google Homepage. The layout of elements were positioned using Flexbox, which I have no clue if I utilized it correctly. But here it is. Also, I am aware of differences that I just couldn't nail. Such as, the position of the links in the header; same with the footer; the search bar is not quite the same width, nor the same shadow effect; the fonts on the buttons are not the same and they are not the same size either; the 9 squares for the \'Google Apps\' is not the same size or color when hovered over (I will say that I created the image by myself from scratch, though\!). All in all, this was to help me progress and was recommended to me by an awesome person, entrepreneur and web developer, Devon\! (AKA - Rad Devon) Thank you very much\!
